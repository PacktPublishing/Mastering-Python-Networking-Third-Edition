# A JavaScript Alternative for Learning

As I am trying to learn JavaScript I thought it might be fun to create some of the graphics in Chapter 7 of the book using JavaScript. 

As some of us might know, JavaScript frameworks landscape is pretty vast. My pick of poison at this point is [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). For the graphs, I am also using [Google Charts](https://developers-dot-devsite-v2-prod.appspot.com/chart) 

I am using alternative deliminator in anticipation of conflict with Jinja2's usual double curly brackets {{ }} for variables.
